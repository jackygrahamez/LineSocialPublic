	"Unlike other social media, LineSocial is contextually driven: your relationship is limited to the context of standing on line at a given time and place. After the line is over, you can go your separate ways without any long term commitment to a relationship. To that end we do not save messages past the point you stand on line with that person.  We will not provide a mechanism to share pictures or any profile information about you. You should see this app as just a way to make standing on line a little easier.": "Unlike other social media, LineSocial is contextually driven: your relationship is limited to the context of standing on line at a given time and place.
