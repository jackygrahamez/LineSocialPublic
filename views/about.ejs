<h3>What Is This?</h3>
<p>
Ever stand in a long line? Wish you could make a friend towards the head? 
LineSocial will facilitate contextual temporary connections just for such occasions.
You could call this a form of "Contextual Social Media", where you make friends related to 
a specific context.
</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3> 
<p>
Register and account or connect through Facebook. Press "Lines" to find lines
in your area. Agree to use location services so we can find a line at your venue
where someone is checked in.
</p>
<h3>Checked In?</h3>
<p>
Well, in order for this to work, one person has to check in to facilitate the 
interaction. People who check in can be rewarded with points by people who "Line Poke" them.
When you actually check in you are given a list of line lengths in time. These are only
your estimates on how long the line is to help us determine when to terminate a Check In.
If you stray 500 meters away from your Check In for 6 minutes we automatically Check Out
your Check In at which point you need to Check In to become available for Line Pokes.
Depending on if the app is currently active or accepting push notifications, this
feature may not be functional.
</p>
<h3>Line Poke?</h3>
<p>
Yes, well if you have checked in, someone will want to connect to you through a line poke
These pokes are sent by going to "Lines" and then selecting a specific check in from a list.
</div>
<h3>Why no SSL?</h3>
<p>
Since we are in the Alpha phase, we will wait and see if this app warrants going forward. SSL 
certificates are kind of expensive. So we will get to it later.
